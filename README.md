# Discovering Data
This repository is a test project created to demonstrate my data analysis and visualization skills.
The main goal is to present effective techniques for data cleaning, exploration, and graphical representation using Python (e.g., pandas, matplotlib, seaborn).

## Datasets
All datasets used in this project were sourced from Kaggle.


## First steps
Once the repository is cloned, follow the steps below:

1. **Set up Python environment**
   - Make sure Python 3.x is installed
   - Create a virtual environment
       ```
         python -m venv venv
         source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
       ```
2. **Install required packages**
   - Use the provided `requirements.txt` file:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook or Lab**
   - Open the project notebooks for interactive exploration:
     ```
     jupyter notebook
     ```
     or
     ```
     jupyter lab
     ```

4. **Run the notebooks**
   - Step through the notebooks from top to bottom; each section is commented and describes what it does.
